# EmotesBot
EmotesBot is a Telegram bot that allows you to easily send kaomoji ᕕ( ՞ ᗜ ՞ )ᕗ in your Telegram chats.

You can use it right now by typing `@EmotesBot` in a Telegram chat. All the supported emotes are available in the
[emotes.json](https://github.com/devmattrick/emotesbot/blob/main/emotes/emotes.json) file. Feel free to create a PR that
adds more if there's one that you think is missing!
