# EmotesBot
EmotesBot is a Telegram bot that allows you to easily send kaomoji ᕕ( ՞ ᗜ ՞ )ᕗ in your Telegram chats.

You can use it right now by trying `@EmotesBot idk` in a Telegram chat. All the supported emotes are available in the
emotes.json file. Feel free to create a PR that adds more if there's one that you think is missing!
